# Weather Data Project

## Overview
Automated ETL that extracts Casablanca's daily weather forecast  + observed data from an open source project _(wttr.in)_ and loads it into a live report. This ETL automatically runs at 6:00am EST and extracts the weather data for Casablanca for the following day.

## Features
* **Weather Data Retrieval:** The script extracts weather data from wttr.in and saves it with a corresponding timestamp
* **Data Logging:** Captures both the raw data and any errors encountered during execution from 'launchd' on macOS and 'crontab' on Linux
* **Scheduled Execution:** Uses launchd to run the script at a specified time each day for macOS and crontab for Linux


## Setup

**1. Clone the repository** <br>
**2. _For MacOS:_ Ensure the plist file is under /Library/LaunchAgents**
**3. Set the correct permissions**
<br>
          `chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/weather_data_proj/rx_poc.sh`
<br>
**4. Edit the 'launchd' plist file to ensure the file path and schedule is correctly set**
<br>
**5. Launch the plist file** <br>
          `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.your-name.weather_data_proj.plist`
          <br>
